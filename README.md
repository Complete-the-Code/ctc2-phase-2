## Current solve status
**Unsolved**

The website https://completethecodetwo.cards/ was discovered on May, 26 2021 as part of phase I. The site only consists of a text box with a placeholder of `???`.

This site accepts any text input, it sends that data via a POST request to https://completethecodetwo.cards/pw. If the input if wrong it'll return a "Nope." (403), if the input is correct it won't return that (most likely a 404).

Our end goal is to find the input that won't return a 403.

Thanks to @Vcubed in the dbrand Discord they have set up a [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ubfE2XXKmXK1Uws72nwHLYBd_mEdxlCOOoOuhlWRCD0/edit) using a Google Apps Script to track and validate our inputs, but please, don't shit inside it. 

## What is this? (Part II)

On May 26, 2021, some dipshit in the dbrand Discord server (@liatschulz) found the website https://completethecodetwo.cards by using a brain. We have confirmed that the site was created by dbrand using WHOIS records. dbrand has since confirmed that Phase I has been completed and that Phase II has now been started.
